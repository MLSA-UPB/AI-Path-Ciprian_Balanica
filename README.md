Use the left mouse button to draw walls. The walls connect every two succesive points given by the mouse position.
Use the right mouse button to reset the last position so you don't have to write a single line of walls.
To clear all the walls press the middle mouse button.
Update the starting position of the car to the actual mouse position by pressing 'r'.
